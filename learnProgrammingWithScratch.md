# Learn Programming with Scratch

1. Download Scratch

*Not required on Raspberry Pi's running the Rasbian distribution.*

[Download from the official website](https://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/)

2. Run the installer you downloaded.

3. Tutorials

All tutorials are locate on [Scratch's video page](https://scratch.mit.edu/help/videos/).

Scratch videos rarely use the Offline Editor, that you just downloaded, but it will mostly work the same way.
